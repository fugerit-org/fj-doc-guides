# Venus Guidelines : History 

## Version : 1 (2023-08-13)

The Venus library started a lot of years ago.


At the beginning it was a simple library for java 1.4.  

It is still possible to find the original code at [morozko-lib repository](https://github.com/fugeritaetas/morozko-lib).

Especially [org.morozko.java.mod.doc](https://github.com/fugeritaetas/morozko-lib/tree/master/java14-morozko/org.morozko.java.mod.doc).
